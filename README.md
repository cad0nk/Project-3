## Objective

This project aims to implement a comprehensive monitoring system using Prometheus to collect and analyze real-time metrics from servers and applications. By integrating Prometheus with Grafana, the system provides interactive and visually appealing dashboards for better insights into system performance. Additionally, automated alert notifications are configured using Telegram to promptly inform administrators of any anomalies or critical issues, ensuring proactive system management and minimal downtime.

### Skills Learned

- Configuring and deploying Prometheus as a monitoring system.
- Integrating Prometheus with Grafana for metric visualization.
- Writing PromQL queries for metric analysis.
- Setting up alert rules in Prometheus and configuring notifications via Telegram bot.
- Troubleshooting and optimizing monitoring system performance.

### Tools Used

- Prometheus – For scraping metrics from nodes and applications.
- Node Exporter – To collect system metrics from the server.
- Grafana – For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- Telegram Bot API – To send real-time notifications to Telegram.
